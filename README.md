# role-management-app

This template should help you setup this application.

### Technologies Used

This project uses the following libraries:

- Axios: "^1.4.0"
- Vue: "^3.3.4"
- Vue-router: "^4.2.4"
- Vuex: "^4.1.0"
- Tailwindcss: "^3.3.3"
- Typescript: "~5.1.6"
- Vite: "^4.4.6"

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
   1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
   2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

### Start JSON live server

This project uses json live serve since I didn't have much time to setup backend api. Just make sure to use a second terminal to act like a server and run the following command.

```sh
json-server --watch data.json
```

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
